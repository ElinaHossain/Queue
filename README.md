# Queue

## What does it do?
This program demonstrates the usage of a queue data structure in Java. A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
In this program, the queue is used to store and manipulate Game objects. The program showcases various operations that can be performed on a queue, including:
- Adding elements to the queue using the add method.
- Checking if the queue is empty using the isEmpty method.
- Retrieving the size of the queue using the size method.
- Peeking into the queue to retrieve the element at the front without removing it using the peek method.
- Checking if the queue contains a specific item using the contains method.
- Removing elements from the front of the queue using the poll method.
By running this program, you can observe how the queue behaves and see the results of these operations in action. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require queue-like behavior, such as job scheduling, message processing, or breadth-first search algorithms.
